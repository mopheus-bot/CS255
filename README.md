# System Analysis and Design


  This system was designed for DriverPass, an online learning service that helps train students
to pass their driving tests. It includes online learning materials and practice tests, as well 
as scheduling for in-person behind-the-wheel lessons. This system tracks mentors and students, 
and is updated frequently in accordance with any changes from the DMV rules and policies.

  The best part of this project was the requirements collection and definition. The interview 
with the client was extremely helpful with defining the requirements of this system. If I could 
revise one portion of these documents, it would be the system components and design. I would get 
a bit more specific with hardware/software recommendations for the design of this system.

  As previously stated, the interview with the client was extremely useful. It is important to 
fully understand the client's needs from the system, and it is just as important to hear from 
multiple roles within the system. In the case of DriverPass, it was extremely beneficial to hear 
from the IT department, as well as the CEO of the company. Requirements collection helps with 
enhancing customer value and satisfaction, and also helps prevent over-coding.

  I think a good approach to system design is to utilize an agile development system, and to 
start with requirements collection and system design. UML diagrams, as well as Gantt charts, 
are extremely beneficial in the organization and understanding of the system. It is important 
that both the development team and the client are able to fully understand all aspects of the 
system and are able to communicate effectivelty about expectations and limitations.
